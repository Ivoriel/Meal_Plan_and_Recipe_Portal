# ScrumLab

This is a copied repository of a group project that we have developed during our Coders Lab bootcamp. 

The project was to build a portal for creating and managing meal plans that consisted of recipes added by both the admins and the users. 

Project was developed by 5 people and a Scrum Leader.
